Nginx - PHP FPM Monitor

We couldn't find any similar script for Nginx and PHP FPM, so we writed one. It's simple and little bit crud but it does the job.

Installation:
To use this monitor you need to setup Nginx and PHP FPM status pages and then change paths to them in config.php file.

License:
Use it freely on your own servers. If you want to do something with it commercially please contact us first.
